## About

netscanR is an R package that allows you to scan your local network
using `arp-scan`. Output from `arp-scan` is parsed into a tibble that
can be analysed using R.

## Installation

You can install the development version of netscanR from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("stibu81/netscanR")
```

## Setting up `arp-scan`

`arp-scan` must be installed in order for netscanR to work. You can
check that the command can be found by running

``` r
library(netscanR)
find_arp_scan()
#> [1] "/usr/sbin/arp-scan"
```

If `arp-scan` is not found, an empty string is returned. On Linux, you
can usually install `arp-scan` from the official package repositories.
For example, on Debian, Ubuntu and derivatives, you can run

``` bash
sudo apt install arp-scan
```

`arp-scan` should also run on any other Linux distribution, macOS,
FreeBDS and others (see the [arp-scan GitHub
readme](https://github.com/royhills/arp-scan?tab=readme-ov-file#building-and-installing-from-source)),
and once it is installed, netscanR might be able to run. However, this
has only been tested on Ubuntu.

The version of `arp-scan` can be obtained from R using

``` r
arp_scan_version()
#> [1] '1.9.7'
```

If `arp-scan` is not found, the returned version is 0.

netscanR has only been tested with `arp-scan` version 1.9.7.

## Usage

Once `arp-scan` is installed, you can scan the local network from R
using

``` r
run_arp_scan()
```
